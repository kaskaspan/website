# Website Analytics Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up analytics tracking for your website to monitor visitors.

## üéØ What You'll Get

- **Visitor Tracking**: See who visits your website
- **Page Views**: Track which pages are most popular
- **Real-time Analytics**: Monitor visitors as they browse
- **Privacy-Compliant**: Respects user privacy preferences

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Google Analytics Setup (Recommended)

1. **Create a Google Analytics Account**:

   - Go to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)
   - Sign in with your Google account
   - Create a new property for your website
   - Get your Measurement ID (starts with "G-")

2. **Configure Your Website**:

   - Create a `.env.local` file in your project root
   - Add your Google Analytics Measurement ID:

   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
   ```

   Replace `G-XXXXXXXXXX` with your actual Measurement ID.

3. **Deploy and Test**:
   - Your analytics will automatically start tracking visitors
   - Check your Google Analytics dashboard for data

### 2. Simple Analytics (Built-in)

The website includes a simple analytics system that works without external services:

- **Automatic Tracking**: Tracks all page views and visitors
- **Local Storage**: Data is stored in the visitor's browser
- **Privacy-Friendly**: No external data collection
- **Dashboard**: Visit `/analytics` to see your visitor data

## üìä Viewing Your Analytics

### Google Analytics Dashboard

- Select your property
- View real-time and historical data

### Built-in Analytics Dashboard

## üîß Configuration Options

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with these options:

```bash
# Google Analytics (optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX

# Analytics settings
NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=true
```

### Customization

You can modify the analytics behavior in `/lib/config.ts`:

```typescript
export const config = {
  googleAnalytics: {
    measurementId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID || "G-XXXXXXXXXX",
    enabled: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production",
  },
  analytics: {
    enableSimpleAnalytics: true,
    enableGoogleAnalytics: true,
    enablePrivacyMode: true,
  },
};
```

## üìà What Data is Tracked

### Google Analytics Tracks:

- Page views and sessions
- User demographics and interests
- Traffic sources and referrals
- Device and browser information

### Simple Analytics Tracks:
